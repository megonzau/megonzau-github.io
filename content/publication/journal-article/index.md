abstract:  This chapter addresses the construction of a DSGE-SIR model that incorporates the complex relationships between disease, containment, and economic dynamics. It consists of five sections; The first provides an introduction to the havoc wreaked on the global economy. The second analyzes the mechanisms through which economic and epidemiological phenomena are interconnected. The third discusses the calibration process. The fourth presents the model's results. Finally, the fifth section focuses on conclusions and policy recommendations aimed at mitigating both the economic impact on livelihoods and human losses.
