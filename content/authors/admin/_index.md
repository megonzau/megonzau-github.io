# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a passionate economist with a solid background in academia, research, and public sector management. At the Ministry of Economy and Finance, I played a key role in the development of green financial tools such as the Sovereign Green Bonds Framework, climate labeling, and initial steps towards green taxonomy. Additionally, I have extensive experience in handling large databases, including information from Ecuador’s Social Registry, data from Ecuadorian companies, and the Colombian electric sector. My expertise spans research using DSGE and CGE models, and the use of Machine Learning for macroeconomic forecasts. I possess advanced skills in Python, Spark, and SQL/PostgreSQL, and I have led teams as a Technical General Coordinator and National Director of Real Sector Policies.
